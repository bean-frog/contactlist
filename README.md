# contact list
this is just for an AP CSP assignment <br>
uploaded to github for storage <br>
figured i'd make it public bc why not <br>
4 user accounts, that store a separate list of contacts for each <br>
contacts for each user are  under ./data/user(1-4).json <br>
passwords are stored in plaintext (very secure) in ./data/notuserpasswords.json <br>

# to run yourself (idk why you would want to do this this is terrible)
- have nodejs and npm installed
- `npm install`
- `node index.js`
